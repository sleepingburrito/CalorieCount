# CalorieCount
Calorie count is a really simplistic calorie counting application. It tracks weight (of all time) and calories consumed (in a day) by the user (data filled in by the user). I made this more for myself as a toy and a tool. It has helped me and Iâ€™m uploading here so I have a copy in the cloud. It command line only and uses the standard C library.
